This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?
Proof of concept using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [AWS Interactive Video Service](https://aws.amazon.com/es/ivs/) and [BlueprintJS Design system](https://blueprintjs.com/).
 
This project is a proof of concept, not production ready by any means.

## Goals

- Use a design system along with IVS on a react environment.

## Usage
First install dependencies, secondly run the dev command. Webpack dev server will launch the server.

```bash
npm i 
npm dev
```

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/demo.html) to view it in the browser.
